AZ Bighorns study in collaboration with NMGFD and New Mexico State University (NMSU), Las Cruces NM.

The intent of the project is to vertically sample ~60,000 radio collar GPS locations down to their date and hour, by the solar irradiation of the location across an entire year (~5,800 rasters). We also want to calculate heat load of the surface to infer a daily temperature for the site at the time of the GPS ping. 

What are the conditions that the sheep are selecting at that point in time and place? E.g. elevation, slope, aspect, temperature, shading.
