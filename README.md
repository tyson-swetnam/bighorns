The intent of the project is to vertically sample ~60,000 radio collar GPS locations down to their date and hour, by the solar irradiation of the location across an entire year (~5,800 rasters). We also want to calculate heat load of the surface to infer a daily temperature for the site at the time of the GPS ping.
